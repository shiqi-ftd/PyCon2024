- Coding is about Composability


Error Handling

1. Not Part of the Type System
Don’t know what exceptions will emerge
The function can start throwing new ones
C++ and Java tried a shadow type system: exception specifications—didn't work
2. Conflates Categories
Recoverable
Panic: program can't continue
Treated the same as recoverable
Unecessary overhead
3. Exceptions Destroy Partial Calculations
Computationally wasteful, especially with large calculations
Makes debugging harder


The Functional Approach
Stop using exceptions
Functions return a structure combining the answer + potential error
